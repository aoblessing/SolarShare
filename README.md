# SolarShare (PowerBlock) üåû‚ö°

A blockchain-based decentralized solar power infrastructure project built on the Stacks ecosystem using Clarity 2.0. SolarShare enables community-owned solar installations through tokenization, making renewable energy infrastructure accessible and manageable through smart contracts.

## Vision

SolarShare addresses Nigeria's power infrastructure challenges through a decentralized approach to solar power ownership and distribution. By tokenizing solar installations, we enable:

- Fractional ownership of solar infrastructure
- Transparent power distribution
- Automated revenue sharing
- Community-driven governance
- Accessible green energy investment

## Core Features

### 1. Power Share Tokenization
- Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) represent ownership shares in solar installations
- Each token correlates to specific power generation capacity
- Transferable ownership rights
- Secondary market trading capabilities

### 2. Smart Power Distribution
- Automated power allocation based on token ownership
- Real-time tracking of power generation and consumption
- IoT integration for live monitoring
- Dynamic pricing based on time of day
- Emergency power allocation protocols

### 3. Revenue Management
- Automated distribution of revenue from excess power sales
- Transparent tracking of power generation and sales
- Integrated maintenance fund allocation
- Smart contract-managed revenue sharing

### 4. Community Governance
- Democratic decision-making for maintenance and upgrades
- Proposal creation and voting system
- Maintenance schedule management
- Emergency protocol activation

### 5. Mobile Integration
- Real-time monitoring through mobile app
- USSD integration for non-smartphone users
- Power consumption tracking
- Revenue and voting dashboard

## Technical Architecture

### Smart Contracts
1. **Token Core Contract**
   - NFT implementation
   - Token metadata management
   - Transfer and ownership rules

2. **Power Distribution Contract**
   - Power allocation tracking
   - IoT device integration
   - Usage rights management

3. **Revenue Contract**
   - Revenue pool management
   - Automated distribution
   - Maintenance fund allocation

4. **Governance Contract**
   - Proposal creation and voting
   - Emergency protocols
   - Maintenance scheduling

## Integration Points

### IoT Integration
- Smart meters for power tracking
- Real-time data feed to blockchain
- Automated power distribution control

### Mobile App
- Token management
- Power consumption monitoring
- Voting interface
- Revenue tracking

### USSD Interface
- Basic token information
- Power allocation checking
- Simple voting mechanisms
- Balance checking
